# Compressly

**Compressly** is a desktop app built with Electron that compresses images and videos to a target file size. Itâ€™s designed to be simple, fast, and useful, especially for people who need lightweight media without sacrificing quality.

There are many tools for compressing videos, but few that also support
images & audio, fewer still that work entirely offline, and even fewer
that don't have some sort of file size limit and/or lock features
behind a paywall.

So I decided: Why not make my own? With little to no coding experience, I used GitHub Copilot to make it a reality, prompting, refining, and troubleshooting until it matched how I wanted it to be. Compressly is the result of persistence, curiosity, and creative direction.

# Compressly

**Compressly** is a desktop app built with Electron that compresses images and videos to a target file size. It’s designed to be simple, fast, and useful—especially for people who need lightweight media without sacrificing quality.

I’ve wanted a tool like this for years. With no coding experience, I used GitHub Copilot to help bring it to life—prompting, refining, and troubleshooting until it matched my vision. Compressly is the result of persistence, curiosity, and creative direction.
